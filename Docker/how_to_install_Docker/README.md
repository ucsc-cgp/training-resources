# How to Install Docker
This document is derived from a handout planned for Dockstore's training modules.

## FAQs

### How long will it take?
To install on a Mac or typical Linux machine, we expect installation to take 5 minutes or less. If you are using a Windows machine that isn't already set up to use virtualization, this process might take 15-20 minutes.

### Can I install Docker on...?
There are thousands of combinations of computers, hardware, and software out there. We can't reasonably support everything, but we're going to try to cover the most common use cases here: Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Note that this guide is about installing Docker on your actual computer, not an HPC that your computer connects to. Every HPC is different, so we can't provide general guidance on installing on HPCs. In fact, many HPCs do not allow the usage of Docker for security reasons.

## General requirements
☑ 64-bit machine (if you're not sure if you have this, [read this article](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001121.htm))  
☑ At least 4 GB of RAM  
☑ At least 10 GB of free disk space  
☑ Root/Admin permissions  

It is technically possible to [install Docker on a 32-bit machine](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37989534/how-to-install-docker-on-32bit-machine-having-ubuntu-12-04) or [without root permissions](https://medium.com/@tonistiigi/experimenting-with-rootless-docker-416c9ad8c0d6), but we don't recommend doing this.

It's recommended to use something based on either Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, or Arch,<sup>‡</sup> because these Docker provides packages for these four. 	|
| PRE-REQS 	| [Installing WSL-2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#install-wsl-command), then [download the Linux update kernel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package).<sup>†</sup> Next, [ensure that virtualization is enabled in Task Manager](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/troubleshoot/#virtualization-must-be-enabled). If not, you can [enable it in either your Windows settings or in your BIOS](https://www.minitool.com/news/enable-virtualization-windows-10.html).  	| If and only if you are using a MacBook with Apple Silicon hardware, [install rosetta-2](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861), as some features of Docker require it.    	| None   	|
| INSTALL  	| Assuming all prereqs have been met, simply download Docker Desktop from the top of https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/ and run the installer. If given the choice during installation, select WSL-2 (unless you are certain you are using Hyper-V).                                                                                                                                                                     	| There are two different versions of Docker Desktop depending on whether you're using Apple Silicon or not. Once you download the correct one from the top of  https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/ , run Docker.dmg. In the window that pops up, drag Docker.app into the Applications folder. 	| Instructions vary per distribution: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/linux/install/#generic-installation-steps   	|

<sup>†</sup>If you have Windows 10/11 Pro or Enterprise, you can use [Hyper V](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/troubleshoot/#hyper-v) instead of WSL-2, but there isn't really an advantage to doing this. You'll still need to set up Windows for virtualization in your settings/BIOS.
